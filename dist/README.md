# LeetCode
This is a project that contains questions from LeetCodes site, and my solutions. This is wrapped in a framework that lets you run the questions by file. Files are named the same as the question names. You can also pass in the questions parameters. This is mainly used to keep track of my solutions, while experimenting with ES6. If others want to add to this repo, please follow the TwoSum example in this project. This project is for learning purposes, and a way for me to keep history of my own answers.
